From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.\\n\\nFor anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).\\n\\nThere is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone.
